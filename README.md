# DEVELOPMENT-OF-AN-IC-BASED-VIBRATION-DETECTION-AND-MONITORING-SYSTEMS
The vibration detector is an analog circuit that detects mechanical vibrations and provides real-time feedback via an LED. Using an NE555 timer in monostable mode, it processes signals from a nail-spring vibration analyser. Cost-effective and versatile, itâ€™s ideal for applications like machinery monitoring, security systems, and education.
